# MicroPython Scrolling Matrix Display for Acid Watcher Diet

This repository contains the MicroPython code and instructions to build a scrolling LED matrix display unit. It's designed to continuously display phrases related to Dr. Aviv's Acid Watcher Diet, providing a constant reminder of key principles. The physical unit can be built using 3D-printable parts for a neat, enclosed design.

## Hardware Assembly

This project utilizes common MAX7219 8x8 LED matrix modules. The enclosure design is based on an existing Thingiverse model.

### 3D Printed Parts

The structural components for the display unit can be 3D printed. The  `.stl` files are at this Thingiverse link:

### Wiring Diagram

The ESP32-S3-BOX Lite has a limited number of "safe" and accessible GPIO pins for external SPI communication. Based on extensive testing, the following pinout for a **separate SPI bus (SPI2)** is recommended for the MAX7219 module, using safe and exposed GPIOs on the J2/J3 headers. The internal display (OLED) on your ESP32-S3-BOX uses `SPI(1)` internally.

**Connect the MAX7219 modules (chained together) to your ESP32-S3-BOX Lite as follows:**

* **MAX7219 DIN (Data In)** → **ESP32-S3-BOX GPIO39** (on J3 header)
* **MAX7219 CLK (Clock)** → **ESP32-S3-BOX GPIO40** (on J3 header)
* **MAX7219 CS (Chip Select)** → **ESP32-S3-BOX GPIO41** (on J2 header)
* **MAX7219 VCC** → **ESP32-S3-BOX 5V** (on J3 header for best brightness/stability)
* **MAX7219 GND** → **ESP32-S3-BOX GND** (on J3 header)

**Important Notes:**
* Ensure your **MAX7219 modules are powered via 5V**, not 3.3V, for optimal brightness.
* **Double-check that you're connecting to the correct ESP32-S3-BOX headers (J2 and J3)** as indicated. These are the general-purpose headers on the back of the device, not the internal display connection.

## Software Setup

### MicroPython Firmware

Ensure your ESP32-S3-BOX Lite has MicroPython firmware installed. If you're encountering issues, a fresh firmware flash is often a good first step. You can use Thonny IDE's "Install MicroPython" feature or `esptool.py`.
